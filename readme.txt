Adds a widget with randomised quotes powered by ContentWizard, with a choice of five languages (En, De, It, Fr, Es)

== Description ==

ContentWizard Quotes plugin for sidebar widget - displays humorous and thought-provoking quotes from famous people, randomly selected from a large ContentWizard database in English, German, Italian, French or Spanish.

ContentWizard Quotes accesses the ContentWizard.ch host service, which makes a random selection from its database of quotes, according to the language detected or user's setting, or defaults to English. The host service returns a JSON string which contains no coding. This string is displayed in the widget. No code is passed, so the inclusion is completely safe to use.
Our team continuously adds to and translates the quotes in the database, so users can enjoy a changing and variant selection. We attempt to verify that the quote is genuine, and is attributed to the person referenced correctly. If you have a favourite quote you would like to add, or have a complaint, query or suggestion, we would be happy to hear from you: quotes@contentwizard.ch.
